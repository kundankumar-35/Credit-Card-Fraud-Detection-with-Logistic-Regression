# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-with-Logistic-Regression
"This project involves building and evaluating a machine learning model, specifically Logistic Regression, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. A key focus was on addressing the challenge of a highly imbalanced dataset through techniques like undersampling to improve the model's ability to identify rare fraudulent activities."
